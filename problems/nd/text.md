1. Tell me about a coding project that you worked on. What language did you use and what did it do

A: I wanna introduce my portfolio website, Since I'm a front-end developer. About one year ago, I started to build my own website, to show my programming and design works on it. For now, it's already 3rd version. I use vanilla JavaScript and CSS to implement it. The reason that I didn't use framework such as React is that the initial version has just limited content, and it's a good start to improve my javascript skills. Now, I'm going to start fifth version with React. The process is pretty helpful, cause I wanna make it fully responsive, make it look good, make it use smoothly. 

2. Tell me about how you learn new technology. Use an example of when you had to learn a new language or framework.

A: Well, I'm interested in building 3D models and webgl. So I started to learn three.js, the most popular 3D libarary in javascript. At first I found its official document and know about the basic concepts and usages. But I found it's far from enough because there are lots of complex things in 3D world, especially mathmematical knowledge. So I used math textbook, search concepts on wikipedia, or to google articles to figured them out. Then, I started to build them in coding, to make bugs and fix bugs. After all, the practice is the best teacher.

3. What technology and tools do you use when writing code? We want to hear about operating systems, editors, debuggers, and anything else that helps you be efficient and productive

I use both macbook pro and surface rpo. Macbook for coding, surface for reading and buiding 3D models. On mac OS, I replaced default terminal with zsh, and I use Charles to be my HTTP proxy. The IDE is always the VSCODE, you know, it's free, light weight, provides best extensions. I'm a front-end developer, so I use Chrome to debug websites, and I use lighthouse to improve the performance. When I'm coding, I use prettier and eslint to formate my codes, sometimes I configure webpack by myself. At last, I use github to manage my projects.

4. Describe the most difficult bug you ever had and how you solved it.

I think I haven't met much difficult bugs. But I do met some tough problems. The most difficult one is that how to put react and three.js together. Because I wanna seperate them. The react is responsible for the website framework, and three.js is for content. We don't ahve to change framework frequently, but need to update the content. But there are no good methods to combine them on the internet. I try to find some articles about them, I used one of them. But I thought it had some flaws. So I keep modifying the code strcuture, try to wrap common codes into components. And I made it. It's good to learn to imitate at first, and then create new things, make own improvements.

5. why nordstrom

Hounestly, I choose nordstrom  beacause I love shoping, especially shopping online. About  a quarter of my monthly expense I would use on clothes and shoes. As a front-end developer, I especially focus on the user experience of online shopping. If the website is good to use, i'd love to put more time on the website. I would love to pay for the good design. But if the website is sucks, I will close the website directly, because I can get better experience on the local stores. The nordstrom's website catch my eyes and I think it's a good place to start my career. It's nothing better than working on what I love. In addition, the employee discount is a big plus. 

6. What are you hoping to gain from the Nordstrom Technology Internship

The first thing is to improve my programming skills, on the front-end area, Nordstrom does a good work on it. The second is that I wannt to do what I love, it's an obvious reason. I love shopping, I love imrpove user experience, I love making beautiful websites. And for sure, I want to get discounts.
